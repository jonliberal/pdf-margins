# pdf-margins

# What problem does this project solve
When reading pdfs in an iPad, I want to have some space left in the page to add some handwritten notes. I have not found any offline tools that add margins to pdfs so I created this script.

# What does the script do
The script in this project processes pdfs and outputs them with 40% margin on the right.
